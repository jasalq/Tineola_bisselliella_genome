# Tineola_bisselliella_genome

<body>  

This is the companion repository to my Master's thesis. The goal of this project was to assemble and annotate a PacBio sequenced <em> Tineola biselliella </em> genome. It used a modified version of the MAKER 3.01.04 annotation pipeline (Cantarel et al., 2008). We also generated an annotated transcriptome containing RNA sequence data from larvae and adults. Lastly, we performed a differential expression and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses using RNA seq data from early and late-stage larvae, and adults.
