# Tineola_bisselliella_genome

This is the companion repository to my Master's thesis. The goal of this project was to assemble and annotate a PacBio sequenced Tineola biselliella genome. It used a modified MAKER 3.01.04 annotation pipeline (Cantarel et al., 2008). We also generated a transcriptome containing RNA sequence data from larvae and adults.
