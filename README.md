This is the companion repository to my Master's thesis. The goal of this project was to assemble and annotate a PacBio sequenced <em> Tineola biselliella </em> genome. It used a modified version of the MAKER 3.01.04 annotation pipeline  <a target="_blank" href="10.1101/gr.6743907"> (Cantarel et al., 2008) </a>![image](https://github.com/jasalq/Tineola_bisselliella_genome/assets/103665349/b855ca51-fde9-46fe-8883-30d26a49fd40)
. We also generated an annotated transcriptome containing RNA sequence data from larvae and adults. Lastly, we performed a differential expression and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses using RNA seq data from early and late-stage larvae, and adults.
