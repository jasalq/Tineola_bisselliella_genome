This release is the companion repository to my master's thesis. The goal of this project was to assemble and annotate a PacBio sequenced <em> Tineola biselliella </em> genome. It used a modified version of the MAKER 3.01.04 annotation pipeline (Cantarel et al., 2008). We also generated an annotated transcriptome containing RNA sequence data from larvae and adults. Lastly, we performed a differential expression and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses using RNA seq data from early-stage larvae, late-stage larvae, and adults.

<h2> Genome Sequencing and Assembly </h2>
<body>
Two <em> Tineola bisselliella </em> larvae were obtained from an infested skunk fur; their DNA was extracted and sent for PacBio HiFi Sequencing at the University of Deleware. 11 Gb of HiFI reads were assembled using Improved Phased Assembler (IPA) (GitHub: https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbipa). This contig level assembly was then assembled into scaffolds and 30 pseudochromosomes using synteny assisted mapping to a closely related species with a chromosome-level assembly,<em> Tinea pellionella</em> (GenBank accession no. GCA_948150575.1), by Satsuma Chromosembler v.3.0 (Grabherr et al., 2010).
